```
##### Run with a single URL and XML report

```bash
$ python3 run.py -u https://example.com -r XML
```
##### Run with a list of URLs with webhook

```bash
$ python3 run.py -f ./targets.txt -r XML -w https://webhook.url/endpoint
```

##### Run with a list of URLs with webhook and multiple headers

```bash
$ python3 run.py -f ./targets.txt -r XML -w https://webhook.url/endpoint --header "Cookie:session=value" --header "Authorization: Basic test"

```

## Features

- **Blinks** runs Burp Suite scans in a Blinksless mode, allowing for automation without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). This makes it ideal for integration into pipelines or remote servers.
- Single and Batch URL Processing
  - **Single URL Processing:** Easily scan a single target URL.
  - **Batch URL Processing:** Supply a file containing multiple URLs, and Blinks will process each one sequentially, making it efficient for large-scale assessments.

- Customizable Report Generation
  - **HTML Reports:** Easy-to-read format for human review.
  - **XML Reports:** Structured format for machine processing or further analysis.

- Webhook Integration for Real-Time Notifications:
**Blinks** supports webhook integration, allowing you to send scan results directly to a specified URL. This feature is particularly useful for real-time monitoring and integration with alerting systems.

- Crawl Only Mode:
If you only need to map out the structure of a web application without performing a full security scan, you can use the **Crawl Only** mode. This limits the scan to discovering URLs and resources.

- SOCKS5 Proxy Support
For enhanced security during scans, especially in environments requiring VPN connections, **Blinks** includes support for a SOCKS5 proxy running at `localhost:9090`.

- Flexible Configuration
**Blinks** provides a JSON-based configuration file (`config.json`) that allows you to customize various aspects of the scan.
  
## Tested on

- Operating System: `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (AWS)` | `Ubuntu WSL` | `Windows 11 23H2`
- Burp Suite Pro Version: `v2024.6.6`
- Java Version: `openjdk 21.0.4 2024-07-16`

## Attach More Extensions

You can attach more Burp extensions by modifying the `./burpconfig/userconfig.json` file. For example:

```json
<SNIP>
"extender": {
    "extensions": [
        {
            "errors": "console",
            "extension_file": "EXTENSION_PATH",
            "extension_type": "python/java/ruby",
            "loaded": true,
            "name": "Extension Name",
            "output": "ui"
        }
    ]
}
<SNIP>
```
This configuration allows you to load and manage multiple Burp extensions, each defined by its file path, type, and other properties. Simply edit the extension_file path and other fields as necessary to load additional extensions.
